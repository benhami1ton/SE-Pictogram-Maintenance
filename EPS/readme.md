### What's the point of this folder?
This is where you need to place your EPS files. They need to be expanded and flattened in Illustrator.

The EPS files will be moved from here to the `/Import` folder. Then they will move into `/Completed`.
If you have run all the scripts in Glyphs and files remain in this folder or the Import folder, be sure to check the names to ensure there is a glyph with the right unicode/name pairing.
