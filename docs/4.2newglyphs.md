4.2 Create new glyph slots, using the CSV file
-----------------------
Using the first script in the Scripts menu bar, run `Add New Glyphs Based on CSV...`. No Glyphs need to be selected to run this script.

### What does this script do?
This script compares the CSV file to the existing Glyphs file that is open. If there are new entries with Unicode values that are unknown to the Glyphs file, it will create new glyph slots with the name and unicode value from the CSV file.

### What's in this script?
```python
# Import modules needed to run script
import os, csv, GlyphsApp
# Import `csv` module

# Retrieve current working directory (`cwd`)
cwd = os.getcwd()

# Change directory to location of CSV file
os.chdir("/Users/YourUsername/Location/Of/Folder/Containing/CSVfile/")

# List all files and directories in current directory
os.listdir('.')

# Create a dictionary to store the new names
newNames = {}

# Assign each unicode as the key and the new name as the value
def GetUpdatedNames():
    for line in csv_reader:
        if line[-2]:
            newNames[line[0]] = line[-2]
            print(line[1] + ' has been renamed to ' + line[-2])
        else:
            print(line[0] + ' was not changed.')

# Open Pictogram CSV file and check for new entries
with open('CSV-FILE-NAME.csv', 'r') as csv_file:
    csv_reader = csv.reader(csv_file)
    # Skip header information
    next(csv_reader)
    GetUpdatedNames()

# Create list of Unicode values already present in Glyphs App
unicodeChecker = []
for glyph in Glyphs.font.glyphs:
	unicodeChecker.append(str(glyph.unicode))


# Compare the unicode values in the CSV file to the Glyphs file, if there's a new unicode value then add it to the Glyphs file.
for key, val in newNames.items():
	if key in unicodeChecker:
		print(key + ' exists already')
	else:
		newGlyph = Glyphs.font.glyphs['E700'].copy()
		newGlyph.name = val
		newGlyph.unicode = key
		Font.glyphs.append(newGlyph)
		print(key + " doesn't exist already, new glyph made")

```

### Important notes before running script:
You must update this line of code to match the location of the CSV file. Be careful to note backslashes and your Mac's username, and it may be necessary to begin the path with `~/`:
```python
# Change directory to location of CSV file
os.chdir("/Users/YourUsername/Location/Of/Folder/Containing/CSVfile/")
```
You must also input the name of the CSV file, including the `.csv` file extension into this snippet:
```python
# Open Pictogram CSV file and check for new entries
with open('CSV-FILE-NAME.csv', 'r') as csv_file:
    csv_reader = csv.reader(csv_file)
```
Also, if the spreadsheet and CSV have columns added from subsequent updates for new versions, the script can handle additional columns by using a `-2` index value in the function `GetUpdatedNames()`, which searches for the "second-to-last" column in the CSV file. As long as the Pictogram spreadsheet and CSV include icon images/examples, use an index of `-2` to find the names, otherwise use an index of `-1` which is equivalent to the "last column".

This script uses the line of code `newGlyph = Glyphs.font.glyphs['E700'].copy()` to duplicate the `TestSquare` glyph as a template for all new glyphs. It will keep a 1024x1024 square until Step 4.4 when it is removed.
