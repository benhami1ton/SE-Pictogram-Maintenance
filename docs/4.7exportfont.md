4.7 Export Font files
-----------------------
Using standard methods in Glyphs, export the project to all major font versions.

### What does this step do?
This is a multistep process of exporting the different types of font files that are needed for print and web usage.

The following font files are needed:
- OTF
- EOT
- TTF
- WOFF
- WOFF2

### Important notes for this step:
These files will be referenced in the HTML Guide, and so will be helpful to store these fonts in a nearby and easily referenced folder like `/fonts` in the same location as the HTML Guide.

The names of these files will be the same as the name used in the Font Info menu.
