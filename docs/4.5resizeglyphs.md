4.5 Resize the glyphs that are not 1024 units
-----------------------
Select only the glyphs with a unicode value of `E700` or higher, then run `Resize Icons to Full Width...`

### What does this script do?
This script calculates the size of each pictogram and scales it to the full width of 1024 units, which is the UPM of the font. This will ensure that no matter the size of the original icon, it will match the others and allow for reliable placement of the icon along the baseline.

This script also moves the EPS files that are currently in the `Import` folder into the `Completed` folder. This will help you know which pictograms have been fully manipulated. In order to see which pictograms did not import, the script will move the successful ones out of sight, leaving only the potentially problematic files.
### What's in this script?
```Python
import os, GlyphsApp, shutil

# Change directory to location of Import folder
os.chdir("/Users/YourUsername/Location/Of/Project/Folder/EPS/Import/")

currentDir = os.getcwd()
completedDir = "Completed"
thisEPSnewPath = ""

myLayers = Glyphs.font.selectedLayers # current layer

def scaleToUPM():
	for thisLayer in myLayers:
		print (thisLayer.parent.name + ' scaled by factor of ' + str(thisLayer.width / thisLayer.bounds.size.width))
		thisLayer.applyTransform([
                        		thisLayer.width / thisLayer.bounds.size.width, # x scale factor
                        		0.0, # x skew factor
                        		0.0, # y skew factor
                        		thisLayer.width / thisLayer.bounds.size.width, # y scale factor
                        		0.0, # x position
                        		0.0  # y position
                        	])

# Creates new directory for the selected glyph, so Glyphs.app can find and grab it
def moveToCompletedDir():
	thisImportEPSoldPath = str(currentDir + '/' + thisEPSfile)
	thisImportEPSnewPath = str(currentDir + '/' + completedDir + '/' + thisEPSfile)
	if not os.path.exists(completedDir):
		os.makedirs(completedDir)
	shutil.move(thisImportEPSoldPath, thisImportEPSnewPath)
	print "%s Moved into Completed directory." % thisLayer.parent.name


# Loop through selected glyphs, to check if there's a new glyph. If there is, it deletes the paths of the selected glyph, imports the new ones, resizes them to the UPM
for thisLayer in myLayers:
    thisEPSfile = "%s.eps" % (thisLayer.parent.name)
    if os.path.exists(thisEPSfile):
    	moveToCompletedDir()
    	scaleToUPM()
#     	print (thisLayer.parent.name + ' was updated. \n')
    else:
    	print (thisLayer.parent.name + ' was not affected. \n')

```
### Important notes before running script:
Similar to previous steps, this time you must update this line of code to match the location of the EPS files. Be careful to note backslashes and your Mac's username, and it may be necessary to begin the path with `~/`:
```python
# Change directory to location of Import folder
os.chdir("/Users/YourUsername/Location/Of/Project/Folder/EPS/Import/")
```

When Transforming glyphs in this way, it's helpful to skim through the icons after this script runs to check for any anomalies in the objects. Individual glyphs can be manually scaled to 1024 units by selecting all the paths, locking the aspect ratio, and changing the width to 1024.
