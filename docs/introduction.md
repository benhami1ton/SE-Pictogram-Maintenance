# 0. Introduction

0.1 Install Scripts
----------
The bulk of the automation work is handled by Python scripts that are placed within Glyphs, and can be accessed from the menu bar when Glyphs is running. To install these, place the contents of the `Glyphs Scripts` folder into `~/Library/Application Support/Glyphs/Scripts`. The scripts can be kept in a deeper folder for cleaner organization, or each file can be placed in the Scripts folder individually.

After the files have been placed, open the Glyphs app and while holding the Option key, select the Scripts menu item and click "Reload Scripts". This will tell Glyphs to look in the Scripts folder and update it's list within the app. Currently they are not listing in alphabetical order, however this is a bug that the Glyphs developer is aware of.
