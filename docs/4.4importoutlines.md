4.4 Import the EPS outlines to their corresponding glyph
-----------------------
With all the glyphs in your Glyphs App file now containing the correct unicode and name values, we can import the EPS outlines of the pictograms.

With all the glyphs in the file selected run `Import New Outlines...`.
### What does this script do?
This script checks the EPS folder to see if there are files that match the names of pictograms in the Glyphs App file. If there are, it will remove any existing paths or objects in that glyph, in preparation for importing the new paths and objects. It will then move the EPS files that do match into an `Import` folder. Then it will open the `Import > Outlines...` menu item, go to the `Import` folder, and allow you to select all files and open them.
### What's in this script?
```Python
import os, errno, shutil, GlyphsApp, subprocess, time
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE

# Retrieve current working directory (`cwd`)
cwd = os.getcwd()
cwd

# Change directory to location of EPS folder
os.chdir("/Users/YourUsername/Location/Of/Project/Folder/EPS/")


currentDir = os.getcwd()

myLayers = Glyphs.font.selectedLayers
thisEPSnewPath = ""
ImportDir = 'Import'


# Creates new directory for the selected glyph, so Glyphs.app can find and grab it
def moveToImportDir():
	thisEPSoldPath = str(currentDir + '/' + thisEPSfile)
	thisEPSnewPathinImport = str(currentDir + '/' + ImportDir + '/' + thisEPSfile)
	if not os.path.exists(ImportDir):
		os.makedirs(ImportDir)
	shutil.move(thisEPSoldPath, thisEPSnewPathinImport)
	print "%s Moved into Import directory." % thisLayer.parent.name



# Removes paths in selected glyph
def removeGlyphPaths():
	Font = Glyphs.font
	selectedLayers = Font.selectedLayers
	def process( thisLayer ):
		thisLayer.parent.beginUndo()
		for i in range( len( thisLayer.paths ))[::-1]:
			del thisLayer.paths[i]
		thisLayer.parent.endUndo()
	Font.disableUpdateInterface()

	print "Clearing %s." % thisLayer.parent.name
	process( thisLayer )

	Font.enableUpdateInterface()

# Use AppleScript to interact with the Mac's GUI and go to the location of imported Glyphs.
def runascript():
	ascript = """
		tell application "System Events"
			keystroke "i" using command down
			delay 0.5
			keystroke "g" using {command down, shift down}
			delay 0.5
			keystroke "~/Documents/Professional/Schneider Electric/17EC001_IconFont_MaintenanceAndGuide/EPS/Import/"

		end tell
		"""
	p = Popen(['osascript', '-'], stdin=PIPE, stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE)
	stdout, stderr = p.communicate(ascript)
	print (p.returncode, stdout, stderr)

# Loop through selected glyphs, to check if there's a new glyph. If there is, it deletes the paths of the selected glyph, imports the new ones, resizes them to the UPM
for thisLayer in myLayers:
    thisEPSfile = "%s.eps" % (thisLayer.parent.name)
    if os.path.exists(thisEPSfile):
    	removeGlyphPaths()
    	moveToImportDir()
#     	print (thisLayer.parent.name + ' was updated. \n')
    else:
    	print (thisLayer.parent.name + ' was not affected. \n')

# Run import command
runascript()
```
### Important notes before running script:
Similar to steps 4.2 and 4.3, this time you must update this line of code to match the location of the EPS files. Be careful to note backslashes and your Mac's username, and it may be necessary to begin the path with `~/`:
```python
# Change directory to location of EPS folder
os.chdir("/Users/YourUsername/Location/Of/Project/Folder/EPS/")
```

The `runascript()` function is a string of AppleScript code that will use the keyboard shortcut `Command + I` to open the Import Outlines... menu item. This must be assigned in System Preferences, under Keyboard Settings, and in the Shortcuts tab. The shortcut must be listed exactly as `File->Import->Outlines...` to access the menu item properly.

`runascript()` is a part of this script that is not crucial to its success. If there are any errors with running AppleScript within Python, this script should still remove the paths of each glyph and you can manually Import Outlines, choose all the EPS files, and Glyphs will bring them into their respective slots.
