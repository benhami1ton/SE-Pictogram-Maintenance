# 1. Create Project Directory
The location of your stored files is crucial to the success of using these tools, because many of the scripts reference exact locations on your computer. Familiarize yourself with how your Mac files are stored, and choose a place to store the project files. This can be anywhere on your computer, but the folders within your project folder must resemble this outline:

```
Project Folder
├── SpreadsheetExport
├── EPS
│   └── Import
│       └── Completed
└── Glyphs
```
The `EPS > Import > Completed` tree is the most important in this step, because the scripts are looking for those folders to move EPS files as they are being processed.
