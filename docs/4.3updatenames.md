4.3 Update the names of all glyphs, using the CSV file
-----------------------
Using the first script in the Scripts menu bar, run `Rename Glyphs from Pictogram CSV...`. No Glyphs need to be selected to run this script.
### What does this script do?
This script, like in step 4.2, systematically checks the Glyphs file for unicode values that match the CSV file being used. If the unicode values match, it will rename the glyph's name to match what's in the CSV file.
### What's in this script?
```python
# Import modules needed to run script
import os, csv, GlyphsApp

# Retrieve current working directory (`cwd`)
cwd = os.getcwd()
cwd

# Change directory
os.chdir("/Users/YourUsername/Location/Of/Folder/Containing/CSVfile/")

# List all files and directories in current directory
os.listdir('.')

# Create a dictionary to store the new names
newNames = {}

# Assign each unicode as the key and the new name as the value
def GetUpdatedNames():
    for line in csv_reader:
        if line[-2]:
            newNames[line[0]] = line[-2]
            print(line[1] + ' has been renamed to ' + line[-2])
        else:
            print(line[0] + ' was not changed.')

# Open Pictogram CSV file and check for new entries
with open('CSV-FILE-NAME', 'r') as csv_file:
    csv_reader = csv.reader(csv_file)
    # Skip header information
    next(csv_reader)
    GetUpdatedNames()

# Compare the unicode values in the CSV file to the Glyphs file, if the unicode values match, then make the names equal as well.
for key, val in newNames.items():
  for glyph in Glyphs.font.glyphs:
		if glyph.unicode == key:
			glyph.name = val
			print(str(glyph.unicode) + ' has become ' + str(glyph.name))
		else:
			print(str(glyph.unicode) + ' is unchanged')

```
### Important notes before running script:
Like in step 4.2, you must update this line of code to match the location of the CSV file. Be careful to note backslashes and your Mac's username, and it may be necessary to begin the path with `~/`:
```python
# Change directory to location of CSV file
os.chdir("/Users/YourUsername/Location/Of/Folder/Containing/CSVfile/")
```
You must also input the name of the CSV file, including the `.csv` file extension into this snippet:
```python
# Open Pictogram CSV file and check for new entries
with open('CSV-FILE-NAME.csv', 'r') as csv_file:
    csv_reader = csv.reader(csv_file)
```
