4.7 Create HTML guide for reference
-----------------------
Select all the Pictograms in the project and run the script `Create HTML Guide from Selected Glyphs...`

### What does this script do?
This script creates an HTML page that contains a list of all the Pictograms, with some basic info including the name, icon, and unicode value for reference.
### What's in this script?
### Important notes before running script:
While it is not the most eloquent piece of HTML/CSS code, this is meant to be as self-contained as possible. In this version, you only need to share the `.html` file and `/fonts` folder together.

If you want to make the latest version of the Pictogram font always accessible, it is best to store exported font files on a web server that can be called up by this guide. That would allow this single HTML file to be shared and always show the latest version of the pictograms.
